# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using clinical parameters and a logistic regression model. The project involves full exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing with outlier treatment and missing value imputation, encoding, scaling, and model training via Scikit-learn pipelines.
